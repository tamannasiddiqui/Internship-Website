                                     <p>
                                     Social media is a community for honest engagements with clients, and often these platforms make you reach clients who are loyal and with whom you can build long-term contracts. Additionally, to promote product proceedings, you can utilize social platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.
                                      to share the stories that are not related to the product and visuals that will evoke strong sensations and the drive to "share."
                                   </p>
                                 </div>

                                    <h5>2. Customer Service Prioritization</h5>
                                     <p>
                                     For many clients, a company Twitter handle or Facebook page is their primary resource of customer-service, and the last thing you wish is for unsatisfied clients to share pessimistic experiences with other participants. To avoid any negative influence on your brand value, be on top of client issues by acknowledging all their queries as soon as possible with a satisfactory resolution.
                                      If you lack sufficient staff to offer this level of assistance, go for spending on social monitoring tools.
                                   </p>
                                 </div>

                                 <div>
                                    <h5>3. Identify that social media and mobile go concurrently</h5>
                                     <p>
                                     Enterprises of all sizes cannot overlook the essential influence of mobile use on a daily basis.
                                      A recent study had 85% of Americans stating that mobile accessories are an integral part of their
                                       daily life. With more than a billion active users each month, the Facebook mobile application is
                                        an ideal platform for approaching a massive volume of purchasers on the go. As with Twitter, Facebook enables you to create a catalog of posts with item deals,
                                      associated with promo codes, compelling visuals, and direct links for shopping. 
                                     </p>
                                 </div>

                                 <div>
                                    <h5>4. Never underestimate the Trading power of a hashtag</h5>
                                     <p>
                                     Merchants proceed to revolutionize the approaches clients use to engage with their brand on social media. For instance, Amazon has raised their social commerce with #AmazonCart,
                                      which enables Twitter users to add items from tweets with a direct link to their shopping cart so they can buy the product later.
                                    You don't require any advanced technology to generate desired outcomes. Employ a similar approach by 
                                    utilizing social media sharing tools that are available for free, like Hootsuite, to schedule frequent tweets concerning product proceedings, vacation campaigns or business storytelling. Every tweet should introduce an appealing visual, direct link, promo code for buying and an appropriate hashtag.
                                   </p>
                                 </div>

                                 <div>
                                    <h5>5. Attach an online store right onto social platforms</h5>
                                     <p>
                                     You can boost your digital reach even more by directly attaching a shopping cart onto your FB page, so your clients can purchase and shop without ever dropping down from Facebook. You can also connect an online shop to your WordPress blog where you can advertise your items and products. These tools lean to be mobile-friendly and accommodate
                                      any device so that you can guarantee a smooth shopping experience for the valued clients
                                   </p>
