                                    <p>Advertising online has turned out to be an indispensable component of making your brand digitally active and ahead of competitors.
                                     Consequently, the number of internet users has multiplied over the last decade, and as a result, this transformation has 
                                     dramatically influenced the way shoppers buy products & communicate with merchants.</p>

                                    <p>What does digital marketing actually mean? It is another form of advertising where everything 
                                        is carried out online instead of physical advertising.
                                        The significant difference between digital marketing and traditional advertising is this:
                                            In case of online advertising you are aware of your targeted audiences and can limit the visibility of the ad to these 
                                            audiences and eliminate unwanted or irrelevant ad display,
                                             but in traditional marketing we can't restrict the reach of our ad to any specific range, area, or group.
